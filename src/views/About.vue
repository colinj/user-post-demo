    <h1>User Postings Demo</h1>
    <p>
      This application was written in Vue 3 using the composition API. It is a
      demonstration application that makes use of a simple API to display a
      single user and their posts as well as the detailed post and its comments.
    </p>

    <h4>The requirements</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Build a new Vue.js application to load and display posts and comments
        from some of the APIs available here:
        <a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/" target="_blank">
          https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        We don't require you to implement any type of authentication. Just
        assume you are browsing the application as user ID 3.
      </li>
      <li>
        We would like to see a screen displaying the titles of all the posts for
        user 3, with the ability to click through to another screen displaying
        the title and body of the post that was clicked on, as well as the
        comments related to this post.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep the UI/UX simple. It's ok to bring in a library like Bootstrap,
        Tailwind or other.
      </li>
    </ul>
