# user-post-demo

## Requirements

- Build a new Vue.js application to load and display posts and comments from some of the APIs available here: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

- The posts API endpoint is https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts and the comments API endpoint is https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments more information about the API contract is available here: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/

- We don't require you to implement any type of authentication. Just assume you are browsing the application as user ID 3

- We would like to see a screen displaying the titles of all the posts for user 3, with the ability to click through to another screen displaying the title and body of the post that was clicked on, as well as the comments related to this post.

- Keep the UI/UX simple. It's ok to bring in a library like bootstrap, tailwind or other.
